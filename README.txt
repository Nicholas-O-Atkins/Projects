README

This is a public repository for the code I've written some of more recent stuff had contributions
of other group members however, I have changed a lot of the code to work the way I wanted 
things to. That being  said I still kept their names in the main of the code because they
participated in the creation of the original code.

The repo is split into course work or personal work and inside those it is split according to the language used in the program or the class I created it for. If you have any questions about the content of the repositories feel free to contact me at my email.
