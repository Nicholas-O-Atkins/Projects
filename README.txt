README

This is a public repository for the code I've written some of more recent stuff had contributions
of other group members however, I have changed a lot of the code to work the way I wanted 
things to. That being  said I still kept their names in the main of the code because they
participated in the creation of the original code.

The repo should be broken into different sections based on the language used or the year
it was created. There is a lot more code from earlier in university because that was when
I was learning how to code properly, I've been working on some personal projects as of late
and am looking to apply for a work term starting in may that will span 8 months. My hope is 
that with this code I might be considered for my potential as a programmer.
